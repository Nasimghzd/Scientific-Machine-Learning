# 1. Goals
* Quick goal: Overtrain a GNN on a grid, check if outperforms 2-level RAS and FGMRES.
* Middle goal: Training a GNN on a dataset of grids of fixed size, test on grids of the same size which are not in the training set
* Stretch goal: Training a GNN on a dataset of grids of fixed size which can be used to arbitrarely larg grids and outperform conventional methods

# 2. Data
* We generate our own data by descritizing Helmholtz on unstructured grid.
* We verify our methods by comparing it with conventional solvers.

# 3. Storage
* The data will be stored locally on our laptops.
* We will add a file and specifications for generating dataset in the code repo.
* We will make a git repo for our project.

# 4. Naming
* We will follow notations and naming from Prof. West website.

# 5.Verification
* We will compare our methods to conventional domain decomposition solvers (Restricted additive Schwarz in our case).

# 6. Computing resource
* We expect to run on CPU cores of MacBook Pro (Intel i9)
* If needed a GPU, we will consider Colab and other options.
